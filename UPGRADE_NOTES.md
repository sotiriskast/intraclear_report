# Laravel 12 Upgrade Notes

## Current Status

The application has been prepared for Laravel 12 by updating the following in composer.json:

- `laravel/framework` to `^12.0`
- `laravel/jetstream` to `^5.4`
- `laravel/sanctum` to `^4.1`
- `laravel/telescope` to `^5.4`

## What's Already Compatible

This application already uses many Laravel 12 features:

1. **Modern Bootstrap Structure**: Using the new structure with providers.php and app.php
2. **Middleware Registration**: Already using the new middleware registration in bootstrap/app.php
3. **PHP 8.4 Compatibility**: Already using PHP 8.4, which exceeds Laravel 12's minimum requirement

## Next Steps

To complete the upgrade:

1. Run `composer update` to install Laravel 12 and its dependencies
2. Refresh caches using artisan commands:
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```
3. Run tests to verify everything works: `php artisan test`
4. Update front-end dependencies if needed: `npm update && npm run build`

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Service Provider Changes**: Some service providers may need updates for Laravel 12 compatibility
2. **Third-party Package Compatibility**: Some packages might not be fully compatible with Laravel 12 yet
3. **API Changes**: Review the application for usage of any Laravel APIs that changed in version 12

## Reversion Plan

If issues arise that cannot be quickly resolved, you can revert to Laravel 11 by:

1. Changing back the version constraints in composer.json
2. Running `composer update`
3. Clearing caches as mentioned above
